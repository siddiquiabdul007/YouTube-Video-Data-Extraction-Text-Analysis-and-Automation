I have this iPad Pro 9,7 and it&#39;s still running like a brand new one. But it sits on my side table for video streaming and hasnt been bend!
i honestly thought you were a well established youtuber then got surprised to see you had less than 500 subs, nice video man
Great video!
In a couple months it wouldn&#39;t shock me if you reach 10K! Great quality! Keep up the great work
to fast
i just got this video randomly suggested to me. honestly, for such a good and engaging video editing/format, I thought you had over 100k subs. Nice video
Great video! I&#39;m an Apple user, but some of their design decisions are really shockingly stupid!
Dude you&#39;re underrated.
oh i used to have my ipad pro 9.7&quot; when it was bought in late 2016 too, it was to replace my ipad air 1 for running out of storage and laggy performance. it lasted 4 years with several issues with it, shortly after its warranty expired it came with itunes screen logo even though i didn&#39;t touch any buttons and it didn&#39;t have any bent points, trying to recover or restore it it still failed, so that i had to send mine to the well-known technician i used to fix there, he told me that NAND chip (SSD) itself died, so a bad luck began. not only did i lose all of datas for NAND chip replacement, using for a while after repairing it got many hardware issue symptoms: death of front camera, &quot;panic full&quot; occurence, screen acting crazy (half of touch screen unresponsive permanently, sometimes not turning on), overheating, etc (not sure if it was my technician&#39;s fault or not) but i felt unsafe of continuing using my ipad pro 2016 anymore, though it did last 2 more years until its death. it&#39;s fortunate that i got my ipad pro 11&quot; 2020 on christmas day 2020, and i had moved 2nd data on my pro 9.7&quot; before it stopped working completely üòÆ‚Äçüí®. i have been impressed on my current ipad, that i use it nonstop about 3+ years without any issues like older ipads i had used ü•∞. to my defence ipad pro 9.7&quot; wasn&#39;t a bad tablet, even to this day it&#39;s still the best ipad for those looking for light demands, such as entertainment, some gaming, web browsing, drawing, and more, while going for secondhand + budget saving, and still having 4 speakers, great display (apart from 60hz refresh rate), additional flash light (though very light used) but now you can have better options than this one.<br><br>additional comment: i used to feel happy when upgrading to pro 9.7&quot; from air 1. performance, screen, camera, bunches of technologies, and many more, were everything. and i got it with 128gb, my air 1 was 32 so i used it as an opportunity since my demand began higher. as with many issues i experienced on my pro 9.7&quot;, even to this moment i don&#39;t see a point why pro 9.7&quot; should be a recommendation when buying a used tablet. there are still some other pro 9.7&quot; users using for a long period don&#39;t have any issues, so it&#39;s still fine to see the great condition, despite no longer getting latest ipadOS update support as it is (along with its bigger variant, 12.9&quot;, and other older ones)
oh yeah like an iphone 6 plus?
392th sub
